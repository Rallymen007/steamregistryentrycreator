# Steam Registry Entry Creator
This simple tool adds a bunch of uninstall entries inside the registry for Steam games.

Its original purpose was to facilitate Xfire automatic detection as those keys would get lost if you reinstalled Windows but kept Steam safe on a second drive.

As Xfire went down (sadface) it can still be used if your preferred way of uninstalling Steam games is through the control panel applet rather than the Steam client itself.

## TODO:
- Use correct game icons
- Detect game folder size and set accordingly
